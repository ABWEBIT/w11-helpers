G HUB is a program for configuring Logitech devices. Profiles are stored in G HUB, so the program must be running.\
OMM is a profile manager for Logitech mice. Profiles are stored on the device.

Install G HUB, activate the device's internal memory, and then delete G HUB.

Now you can configure profiles using OMM.

This method will allow you to save disk space, reduce RAM consumption, and speed up profile loading.
