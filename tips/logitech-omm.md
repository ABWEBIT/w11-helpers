G HUB is software for managing Logitech devices. Over time, it starts taking up gigabytes of disk space. The device profile launches and operates only alongside the software, meaning it must always run and consume RAM.

OMM (Onboard Memory Manager) is a utility that allows you to edit the profile stored directly on the mouse. Since the profile starts along with the mouse, the utility only needs to be launched when changes are required. It takes up less than 15 MB of disk space.

If you only need to manage a Logitech mouse, install G HUB, activate the device's onboard memory, and then uninstall G HUB.

You can now configure profiles using OMM.

This method helps save disk space, reduce RAM usage, and speed up profile loading.
